# Calculator_JS
Calculator built primarily with Javascript. 

//use cases
/*
functions for all basic math operators + - * / 
create function "operate" that takes an operator and 2 numbers and calls one of the operator functions
create basic html buttons for each digit, operator and = key
calculator should have a display
calculator should have a clear button
and a delete button
create functions that populate the display when you click the number 
should be storing the display variable somewhere

duh but make it work

update the display to the solution

part 2:
should be able to string together several operators and values and get the right answer
odin says not to worry about order of operations buuuuut if we have time we'll circle back to it

round answers with too long of decimals

edgecase: pressing = before you have 2 values and an operator
edgecase: pressing 'clear' doesnt clear the variables and the display
edgecase: dont let user divide by 0

extracredit: allow floating point numbers

extracredit: make it look nice (always)

extracredit: backspace button (delete, not clear)
*/

steps::

build the buttons in html
build the operator functions
(test operators before adding in = functions)
work on display and css layout

notes::
numbers are built into 'number' class
operators are built into 'operator' class
=, del, and clear are built into 'func' class
